Description: iTALK, a computational approach to characterize, compare, 
    and illustrate intercellular communication signals in the multicellular
    ecosystem using either bulk RNA sequencing data or single cell RNAseq data. 
    iTALK can in principle be used to dissect the complexity, diversity, and 
    dynamics of cell-cell communication from a wide range of cellular processes.
